# AdventurePro-Retail: SQL Analytics Recommendation System
End-to-end SQL project on a synthetic multichannel retail dataset. Includes DB design, data cleaning, KPIs, advanced analytics (channels, margins, portfolio, segmentation) and a pure SQL item–item recommendation system using CTEs, window functions, joins, and indexing.



### Objective
Using a **synthetic dataset** that simulates realistic multichannel retail sales (2015–2018), this project:

Builds a clean, normalized **relational schema**.

Prepares and integrates data for analysis.

Generates **KPIs** and advanced business analytics.

Implements a pure SQL **item–item recommendation system**.


### Dataset
All data is **synthetically generated** to mimic real-world sales, products, channels, and stores, avoiding any sensitive information.


###  Modeling & Preparation

**1. Integration & Cleaning**
    - Created aggregated sales table (sales_agg) with calculated revenue (SUM(quantity * offer_price)), standardized date formats, and normalized keys.

**2. Data Governance**
    - Primary and foreign keys, constraints, and indexing for performance.

**3. Operational Views**
    - Order-level view to simplify analysis and reporting.



### Business Analysis
  - Channel performance **ranking** and revenue **trends**.

  - Top stores and **quarterly revenue** by country.

  - Margin and discount **outlier detection (P90)** with window functions.

  - **Portfolio contribution analysis** (top products = 90% revenue).

  - Detection of **trending products**.

  - **Customer segmentation** (2×2 matrix by orders/revenue).

  - **Inactive customer detection** for reactivation campaigns.



### Recommendation System
  - Built using an **item–item** co-occurrence matrix.

  - Suggests products **not yet purchased** by each store.

  - Implemented **fully in SQL** without external tools.



### SQL Techniques Used

  - CTEs, subqueries, window functions (ROW_NUMBER, PERCENT_RANK, CUME_DIST, LAG), complex joins, views, constraints, indexing, and performance optimization.



### How to Run
  **1. Create the database and import** initial tables (sales, products, channels, stores).

  **2. Run setup.sql** to prepare aggregated tables, keys, and views.

  **3. Run analysis.sql** for business KPIs and analytics.

  **4. Run recommendation.sql** to generate product recommendations.
